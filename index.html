      <h2>History of Paper Cups</h2>
      <p>
        Paper cups were first introduced in the early 20th century as a sanitary alternative to reusable cups shared in public places, which were often linked to the spread of diseases. Initially called "Dixie Cups," they were widely adopted for their convenience and hygiene.

      <h2>Discovery of Paper Cups</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of paper cups emerged from the growing concerns about public health during the early 1900s. The discovery revolutionized how people consumed beverages on the go, paving the way for disposable cups in various industries, from coffee shops to fast-food chains.

      <h2>Disadvantages of Paper Cups</h2>
      <p>
        Despite their convenience, paper cups contribute significantly to environmental pollution. They are often coated with plastic to make them waterproof, which complicates recycling processes. 
        Manufacturing paper cups consumes valuable natural resources like trees and water. Moreover, the production emits greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change.
        Single-use paper cups also end up in landfills, taking years to decompose. This creates an urgent need to reduce their usage and explore eco-friendly alternatives.
